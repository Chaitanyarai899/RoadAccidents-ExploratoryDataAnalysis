# Road Accidents - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of road accidents data. The aim of the project is to gain insights and extract meaningful information from the dataset related to road accidents. Python analysis and visualization libraries have been utilized, along with Tableau dashboards, to analyze and present the data effectively.

## Introduction

Road accidents pose a significant challenge to road safety and can have severe consequences. This project aims to analyze road accidents data to understand the underlying factors and patterns associated with these incidents. By conducting exploratory data analysis, we can identify trends, correlations, and potential risk factors that contribute to road accidents. This analysis can provide valuable insights for policymakers, traffic authorities, and stakeholders to improve road safety measures and reduce the occurrence of accidents.

## Technologies Used
- Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib etc have been used with tableau dashbords for in depth visualization. Excel for some additional data cleaning and transformation.
  
## Aim

The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on road accidents data to achieve the following objectives:

1. Identify the geographical distribution of road accidents and analyze accident rates across different regions or states.
2. Investigate the factors contributing to road accidents, such as weather conditions, road types, vehicle types, and driver demographics.
3. Explore temporal patterns in road accidents, including daily, monthly, and yearly variations.
4. Analyze the severity of accidents and identify the major causes of severe accidents.
5. Discover any correlations or relationships between different variables and accident outcomes.
6. Provide meaningful visualizations and insights that can be utilized for decision-making, policy formulation, and the implementation of effective road safety measures.

By conducting a comprehensive exploratory data analysis, this project aims to contribute to a better understanding of road accidents and facilitate evidence-based strategies for improving road safety.
